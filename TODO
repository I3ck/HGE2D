write proper readme with example
gradients
rename gl methods to fill or stroke or wired

add classes for velocity and collision etc to use same function name for all types 

remove bordered rectangle, since it's too complicated to use with transparency

font is currently fixed, make it possible to set it

shapefactory needs major refactor

move more geometry helpers here and define them by class params

unify class names (little wild currently)

add example (maybe new github page which uses HGE2D)

with sizes etc. the transform to gl methods will work on HasSize interface, start adding them to the engine

transform code of example2 has to become part of the engine

build instructions in readme

hackage, stack

missing callbacks for keyboard interaction

add camera transform to renderinstructions and write helper method which is able to transfer pxPos to glPos (scale and translate on total rendering)
(see example 2) (add two function versions, one where 0/0 is at upper left, one where 0/0 is at lower left)

better describe examples

give examples actual names to make it easier to navigate them later on
