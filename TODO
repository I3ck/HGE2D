write proper readme with example
gradients
rename gl methods to fill or stroke or wired

add classes for velocity and collision etc to use same function name for all types 

remove bordered rectangle, since it's too complicated to use with transparency

font is currently fixed, make it possible to set it

shapefactory needs major refactor

move more geometry helpers here and define them by class params

unify class names (little wild currently)

add example (maybe new github page which uses HGE2D)
