use record of functions instead of classes and instances?
geometry.hs needs cleanup

write proper readme with example
gradients
rename gl methods to fill or stroke or wired

add classes for velocity and collision etc to use same function name for all types

remove bordered rectangle, since it's too complicated to use with transparency

font is currently fixed, make it possible to set it

Shapes needs major refactor

freeze dependencies

move more geometry helpers here and define them by class params

unify class names (little wild currently)

add example (maybe new github page which uses HGE2D)

with sizes etc. the transform to gl methods will work on HasSize interface, start adding them to the engine

transform code of example2 has to become part of the engine

build instructions in readme

hackage

missing callbacks for keyboard interaction

add camera transform to renderinstructions and write helper method which is able to transfer pxPos to glPos (scale and translate on total rendering)
(see example 2) (add two function versions, one where 0/0 is at upper left, one where 0/0 is at lower left)

better describe examples

give examples actual names to make it easier to navigate them later on

example where e.g. rectangle rotates around cursor pos

example3 rectangle wont properly show without hovering the mouse (bug?)

some examples have incorrect text (e.g. example2 and 3 stating that input is ignored, while not ignoring it)

improve example texts

add screenshots

merge HasSize and Resizeable

GlFunctions should basically not be used, split it into functions which should be used and those who should not.

test keydown keyup and mouse up

add examples for keyboard interaction

physics types

add special key interaction

loading shapes from common filetypes

define all types in units

more examples and update the README

tests!

use maybe types in methods like closest

also document function params or fields of data types

search structures (quad tree) for faster collision detection
